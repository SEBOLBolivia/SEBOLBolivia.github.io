##### Likelihood evaluation of models with occasionally binding constraints

The paper by by our colleague **Pablo Cuba Borda** on “Likelihood evaluation of models with occasionally binding constraints”, co-authored with Luca Guerrieri, Matteo Iacoviello and Molin Zhong, documents how solution approximation errors and likelihood misspecification, related to the treatment of measurement errors, can interact and compound each other.

##### Paper summary

Applied researchers interested in estimating key parameters of DSGE models face an array of choices regarding numerical solution and estimation methods. We focus on the likelihood evaluation of models with occasionally binding constraints. We document how solution approximation errors and likelihood misspecification, related to the treatment of measurement errors, can interact and compound each other.
