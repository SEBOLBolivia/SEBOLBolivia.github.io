#### Promoting renewable energy and the risk of energy poverty in Chile

**Luis Gonzales (SEBOL, University of Chicago)** contributed the following investigation: **Promoting renewable energy and the risk of energy poverty in Chile** as a chapter to the book: *"Narratives of Low-Carbon Transitions: Understanding Risks and Uncertainties. Edited by: Susanne Hanger-Kopp and Jenny Lieu, Alexandros Nikas. Routledge, London. 2019"*. The chapter is co-authored with Rodrigo Cerda (CLAPES-UC). Congratulations  Luis!

The book is part of the **Transitions Pathways and Risk Analysis for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies - TransRisk**, started in September 2015 under the umbrella of EU Horizon 2020 programme.The volume provides an interdisciplinary, conceptual framework to assess risks and uncertainties associated with low-carbon policies and applies this consistently across 11 country cases from around the world, illustrating alternative transition pathways in various contexts.


#### Paper summary

Over the past decade Chile has successfully followed a low-carbon pathway based largely on solar power and has received international praise for this positive development. However, on closer analysis this trajectory may have a negative impact by amplifying energy poverty. The Chilean narrative discusses the country’s low-carbon pathway in the context of other objectives. It focuses particularly on the carbon tax established in 2017 as a manifestation of the country’s commitment to this pathway, and the potential risk of increasing energy poverty under four scenarios. This risk could be mitigated by creating a mechanism for monetary compensation for the most vulnerable population. The engagement process designed for this analysis revealed additional risks and uncertainties associated with Chile’s low-carbon futures that cannot (yet) be quantified.
