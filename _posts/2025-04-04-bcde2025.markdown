##### Call for Papers for BCDE 2025 is Open

**SEBOL** invites individual submissions of research papers for presentation in parallel contributed sessions. We welcome submissions across all areas of development economics, including interdisciplinary work that provides novel insights into development-related issues. While full papers are strongly preferred, extended abstracts will be exceptionally considered. Preference will be given to unpublished work. All submitted papers will be reviewed prior to acceptance for presentation, and all applicants will be notified of the outcome by email. **Submit my paper** [here](https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/conference.cgi?action=login&db_name=BCDE16)

Proposals for an entire thematic session are also welcome. For this, please submit three (3) papers individually using the link above and email the conference organizers to alert them about your proposed thematic session. Please note that all papers submitted as part of a thematic session will be reviewed individually. A thematic session will be formed if all papers are accepted. Otherwise, individually accepted papers will be allocated to parallel contributed sessions.
