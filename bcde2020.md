<center><h6>July 27th and 28th, 2020</h6></center>


<br>
We are delighted to invite submission of research papers and proposals for thematic sessions for the 11th version of the Bolivian Conference on Development Economics (BCDE2020), which this year will be held **online**, on **Monday and Tuesday July 27th and 28th, 2020**.

<center><h4 style="color:blue;">About the Conference</h4></center>

The Bolivian Conference on Development Economics aims at bringing together local and international scholars for the exchange of ideas and discussion of recent research on all areas related to economic development. We welcome submissions of theoretical and applied research, and we particularly encourage female and Bolivian scholars at an early stage in their careers to submit their work. The conference is organized by the **Bolivian Society of Economists (SEBOL)**, with support from the **Institute for Advanced Development Studies (INESAD)**, the **Bolivian Academy of Economic Sciences (ABCE)**, and **Universidad Privada Boliviana (UPB)**. The conference this year will host special sessions celebrating the launch of the Bolivian chapter of the **United Nations’ Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)** and the launch of the Municipal Atlas of the SDGs in Bolivia.

All individually submitted papers will be reviewed prior to acceptance for presentation.

The deadline for paper submissions is **Tuesday June 30th, 2020**.

BCDE2020 also invites submissions for thematic contributed sessions, for which an organizer can submit three (3) papers using the link above and email the conference organizers describing the proposed session. All papers submitted as part of a thematic contributed session will be reviewed individually. A thematic contributed session will be formed if all papers are accepted. Otherwise, accepted papers will be allocated to parallel contributed sessions.

<!-- #### Logistics ####
Attendance to the workshop is by invitation only, but free of charge. Logistical details will be announced in
late May.
Participants are responsible to cover travel costs, lodging, and visas. SEBOL cannot sponsor nor provide
any assistance towards obtaining a valid visa to travel to the United States. -->


<!-- #### Call for papers ####
We invite interested researchers to submit a one-page summary or preliminary draft of an ongoing
research project. We will accept submissions at all stages of development, but **strongly encourage work in
early stages**. We wish to be inclusive and cast a wide net under the broad theme of development studies.
In addition to economists, we encourage authors from the social sciences and humanities to participate.
We strongly encourage papers at the intersection of multiple fields and those that make use of innovative
research tools.

The call for papers is open to all members of the research community, but priority will be given to young
researchers—doctoral students and recent graduates.

#### Important dates ####
The submission deadline for extended abstracts or drafts is **May 13, 2019**. Submit papers by email to the
workshop chair, **Walter Valdivia**, at [wvaldivi@gmu.edu](mailto:wvaldivi@gmu.edu).
Selected papers will be notified of acceptance by **May 24**. A preliminary draft should be submitted to the
assigned discussants no later than **July 12**. -->
