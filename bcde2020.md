We are delighted to invite submission of research papers and proposals for thematic sessions for the 11th version of the Bolivian Conference on Development Economics (BCDE2020), which this year will be held **online**, on **Monday and Tuesday July 27th and 28th, 2020**.

<center><h4 style="color:blue;">About the Conference</h4></center>

The Bolivian Conference on Development Economics aims at bringing together local and international scholars for the exchange of ideas and discussion of recent research on all areas related to economic development. We welcome submissions of theoretical and applied research, and we particularly encourage female and Bolivian scholars at an early stage in their careers to submit their work. The conference is organized by the **Bolivian Society of Economists (SEBOL)**, with support from the **Institute for Advanced Development Studies (INESAD)**, the **Bolivian Academy of Economic Sciences (ABCE)**, and **Universidad Privada Boliviana (UPB)**. The conference this year will host special sessions celebrating the launch of the Bolivian chapter of the **United Nations’ Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)** and the launch of the Municipal Atlas of the SDGs in Bolivia.
