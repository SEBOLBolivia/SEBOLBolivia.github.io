</h5></center>

We are delighted to invite the submission of papers for the **14th Bolivian Conference on Development Economics (BCDE14)**. The conference will take place in-person from Thursday 9 to Friday 10 November 2023 and will be hosted by **Universidad Católica Boliviana (UCB)** in La Paz, Bolivia.

<h4 style="color:#3C327C;"> ABOUT THE CONFERENCE</h4>

The Bolivian Conference on Development Economics aims to bring together local and international scholars to exchange ideas and discuss recent research on all areas related to economic development. We welcome submissions of theoretical and applied research, and we particularly encourage Bolivian scholars at an early stage in their careers to submit their work.

The conference is organized by the Society of Bolivian Economists (SEBOL), with the support from Universidad Católica Boliviana (UCB), the Bolivian Academy of Economic Sciences (ABCE), the Institute for Advanced Development Studies (INESAD), and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network – Bolivia (SDSN).

<h4 style="color:#3C327C;"> CONFIRMED KEYNOTE SPEAKERS</h4>

**C. Mónica Capra** is a professor in the Department of Economic Sciences at Claremont Graduate University. Her areas of expertise are experimental economics, behavioural economics, and neuroeconomics. Professor Capra is interested in decision processes. Her contributions in behavioural game theory include the explicit modelling of introspection with error and the study of the effects of mood on decisions. She is also interested in the role personality plays in shaping economic choices. Capra has made transdisciplinary studies an important component of her work, and has collaborated with data scientists, neuroscientists, and psychologists. This collaboration has led to important contributions in behavioural economics.

**Claudio Ferraz** is Professor at the Vancouver School of Economics, University of British Columbia, Adjunct Professor at the Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) and Scientific Director of J-PAL LAC. His areas of interest are development, political economy and public economics. In particular, his research focuses on governance and accountability in developing countries, as well as their consequences in the political sphere and in the provision of public services. His current projects examine how voters react to information campaigns, whether pay-for-performance improves the quality of education, and whether increasing the quality of politicians affects public policy.

<h4 style="color:#3C327C;"> SUBMISSIONS</h4>

BCDE14 invites individual submission of research papers to be presented in parallel contributed sessions. Submissions in all research areas related to development economics are welcome. We also encourage submissions of work at the intersection of different fields and disciplines, in particular those that provide novel insights related to development economics.

All submitted papers will be reviewed prior to acceptance for presentation, and all applicants will be notified of the outcome by email.
