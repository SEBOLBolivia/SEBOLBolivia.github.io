The **Society of Bolivian Economists (SEBOL)** is organizing a mid-year meeting to promote the interaction
of members of SEBOL with international scholars. We are aiming to build a network of collaborators to
foster novel ideas and break new ground in development studies.

The meeting will be a **one-day workshop** to showcase 6 to 8 research papers. Each paper will be first
presented by its author, then discussed by an invited scholar, and last discussed in plenary session. All
presentations will be delivered in English.

We strongly encourage papers at the intersection of multiple fields and those that make use of innovative
research tools.

The call for papers is open to all members of the research community, but priority will be given to young
researchers—doctoral students and recent graduates.
