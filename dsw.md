The **Society of Bolivian Economists (SEBOL)** is organizing a mid-year meeting to promote the interaction
of members of SEBOL with international scholars. We are aiming to build a network of collaborators to
foster novel ideas and break new ground in development studies.

The meeting will be a **one-day workshop** to showcase 10 research papers. Each paper will be first
presented by its author, then discussed by an invited scholar, and last discussed in plenary session. All
presentations will be delivered in English.
